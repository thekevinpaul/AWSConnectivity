A short analysis on packeting and why you get connected to the wrong server while playing any game made by EA Sports.


I have written this repository after extensive study for the past month on how the packets released from our routers travel and reach AWS servers(Amazon Web Servers) who currently are in contract with EA Sports.

Of course there is a lot of times, we as gamers, feel we enter matches or matchmaking situations where we feel we are in a game with ping so horrible it is unplayable.

This can be due to 3 factors:
i) Your internet connection is purely not sufficient or fast enough to broadcast or stream your games in a capable manner.
ii) Your bandwidth is incapable of handling too much traffic, this is applicable when there are multiple devices in your house attempting to hog the bandwidth, eg. Someone streaming Netflix, Prime, etc in 4K

<b>iii) You are purely being connected to the wrong server as your ISP is under the impression the route to the server you're connected to, has the least latency.<b>
